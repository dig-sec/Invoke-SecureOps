## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ps_win.git
```

2. Import the module:
```powershell
Import-Module .\ps_win
```

## Usage

### Basic Security Assessment
```powershell
# Run all security tests
Test-SecurityIntegration -RunAllTests -Verbose

# Run specific test categories
Test-SecurityIntegration -TestCategories @("PowerShell", "Defender", "Network")
```

### Automated Remediation
```powershell
# Get security findings
$findings = Test-SecurityIntegration -RunAllTests

# Review what would be fixed
Repair-SecurityIssues -Findings $findings -WhatIf

# Automatically fix issues
Repair-SecurityIssues -Findings $findings -AutoFix
```

### Performance Optimization
```powershell
# Initialize optimization settings
$settings = Initialize-OptimizationSettings -MaxParallelJobs 4 -CacheResults

# Run tests with optimization
Start-ParallelSecurityTests -Tests $tests -Settings $settings

# Clear test cache
Clear-TestCache -CachePath ".\cache" -Force
```

### Individual Security Checks
```powershell
# PowerShell Security
Test-PowerShellSecurity -Verbose

# Windows Defender
Test-DefenderStatus -Verbose

# Network Security
Test-NetworkSecurityProtocols -Verbose
Test-FirewallStatus -Verbose

# Credential Protection
Test-CredentialProtection -Verbose
```

## Configuration

The module can be configured using the following functions:

```powershell
# Get current configuration
Get-Config

# Set configuration value
Set-Config -Section 'Security' -Key 'SeverityLevel' -Value 'High'

# Save configuration
Save-Config

# Load configuration
Load-Config

# Reset to defaults
Reset-Config
```

## Logging

Logging can be configured using:

```powershell
# Set log level
Set-LogLevel -Level 'Info'

# Set log file
Set-LogFile -Path '.\logs\ps_win.log'

# Enable/disable logging
Enable-Logging -Console
Enable-Logging -File
Disable-Logging -Console
Disable-Logging -File
```

## Performance Tuning

Optimize performance using:

```powershell
# Set parallel execution
Set-ParallelExecution -MaxJobs 4

# Enable result caching
Enable-ResultCaching -CachePath ".\cache" -ExpirationHours 24

# Optimize file operations
Optimize-FileOperations -BufferSize 64KB -Compress
```
